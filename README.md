# Internet opinion and sentiment on the willingness of getting the MVC covid-19 vaccine

## ABSTRACT
This research uses the synthetic control method (SCM) to study the causality between the negative public opinion on the Internet and the  number of MVC covid-19 vaccinated. Based on the number of vaccine administration periods provided by the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, some adjustments are made in the administration period, and combined with the public opinion data of the OpView to discuss the effect of negative online public opinion on the number of MVC vaccinated from September 24th, 2021 to October 2nd, 2021. The results of the study show a 98% drop in MVC vaccinations between October 3rd and October 5th, 2021, and a 70% reduction compared to the simulated control group, while the number of MVC vaccinated after October 5th was also lower than that of the simulated control group.
