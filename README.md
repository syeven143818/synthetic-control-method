# Internet opinion and sentiment on the willingness of getting the MVC covid-19 vaccine (Thesis)

## ABSTRACT
This research studies the causality between the negative public opinion on the internet and the number of MVC covid-19 vaccinated by the synthetic control method (SCM). Based on the vaccine data provided by the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, some adjustments are made to the data period in the analysis. Together with the public opinion data of the OpView, this study explores the effect of negative online public opinion on the number of MVC vaccinated from September 24th, 2021 to October 2nd, 2021. The results show a 98% drop in MVC vaccinations between October 3rd and October 5th, 2021, and a 70% reduction compared to the simulated control group. The decrease in the MVC vaccinations has a continuous impact in the later periods.
